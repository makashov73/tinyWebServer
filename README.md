# tinyWebServer

I made a simply web-service on Go for myself needs, that allows me to reach my all my videos from home server PC from anywhere in my local network.

All what you need to use this it's compile this code for one of your OS, place binary file in the same folder, where was placed folder named "files", wich included all your media files.
Then after run, you need to open URL in your browser localhost:8081/files (for your local machine), or domain_name:8081/files (for reach access from network).

Enjoy :)

For working this server properly first of all you need to install package [filetype](https://github.com/h2non/filetype)
